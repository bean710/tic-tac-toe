How to Run It:
=====
If you have perl installed, just run `perl ttt.pl`

If you have a compatible system, you can just use one of the precompiled
binaries.
- MacOS (Tested on 10.15): MacOS_ttt
- Ubuntu (Tested on 16, but would likely work on other Linux distros/versions):
	Ubuntu_ttt

Compile it yourself:
=====
As long as you have perl installed, you can clone the repository and run
`compile.sh` and then run the `ttt` executable.
